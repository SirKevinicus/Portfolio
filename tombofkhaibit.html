                            <b>Tomb of Khaibit</b> is a co-op dungeon crawler where you play as archaeologists exploring a newly unearthed tomb in Egypt.
                            In the dungeon, you'll discover horrifying creatures and magic from the Egyptian gods.
                        </p>

                            The tomb is procedurally generated and the puzzles you'll need to escape are randomized, meaning each tomb will be a new experience.

                                I am the <strong>Environment Artist</strong> and a <strong>Programmer</strong> for this project. I created an Editor Tool
                                called <strong>Texo</strong> that is responsible for procedural generation. I also made the pixel art for the environment.

                    <div class="col-sm-6">

                        <p>
                            The Texo editor is what I am most proud of developing for this game. I spent around 60 hours creating it.
                        </p>

                            We needed a solution for Unity that let us procedurally generate our tomb. Unfortunately, Unity doesn't have any built-in Tools
                            and the Asset Store has no solutions for a roguelike game. There was a package called <strong>Strata</strong>, which has 
                            since been removed from the Asset Store that provided a good basis. However, it was very limited in scope: 
                            (1) Rooms all needed to be the same size and (2) Exits needed to be located in certain places.
                        </p>
                        <img class="inline-img" style="max-width: 200px; float: left; padding-right: 20px;" src="img/Tomb of Khaibit/texoarrows.png">

                        <p>
                            So I decided to expand on Strata and make my own editor called <strong>Texo</strong>. Texo uses arrows as connectors which allows
                            for lots of flexibility, including rooms of various sizes and allowing exits to be placed anywhere. It allows us to generate
                            tombs in many different formats.
