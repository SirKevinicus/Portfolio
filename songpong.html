                        <p>If you're looking for fun things to do on “Maps”, “Yelp”, etc. you can see individual results for "Shopping", "Entertainment", or "Resturaunts".
                            But these results are individualistic and based on businesses and locations, not experiences.

                            <b>Frontier</b> is a platform that promises to crowdsource fun through user-created Journies. Users make Journies, which are like iteneraries with
                            commentary. Then you can search through these Journies wherever you are to find great activities and fun, and even post your own! Frontier would
                            be ideal for anyone on a vacation or looking for something fun to do with your friends.

                            I created this project for my Interaction Design class at my college. During development, we performed User Stories and Scenarios, made Low-Fidelity and High-Fidelity prototypes
                            UI and UX principles, and performed User Tests with feedback.

                <h4>Development Process</h4>
                <p>My group started by creating some low-fidelity mockups using Balsamiq, which is a free-to-use mockup platform.</p>

                <p>These mockups gave us a great starting place to do user tests. From there, we performed three user studies and asked them to perform several
                    tasks such as "Create a New Journey" or "Find a Journey to do" and observed their actions. This process helped us improve on the user
                    experience. Once we finished performing these tests, the high-fidelity prototype was created using Figma, which you can demo above.
