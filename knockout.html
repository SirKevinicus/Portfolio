                            In <strong>Knock-Out!</strong> your goal is to become the crowd's favorite Fighter in a ruthless underground fighting ring. 
                            You'll have to use crazy weapons and outsmart your opponents to rise to the top. 
                            2-6 Players duke it out until someone gets KO'd and then earn Trophies depending on how much they impressed the crowd.

                                grew immensely as an artist, learning the Adobe Suite and artistic process.

                            We ran a  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/402243927/knock-out-global-smackdown">Kickstarter</a> campaign for 
                            KO that received support from our community, but was unable to reach the funding goal.
                            Nevertheless, it's still cool! Check out the project page to see how we marketed the game.

                            In 2015, my friends and I began to work on KO!GS while we were hanging out on the weekend. It started as a fun idea
                            but slowly grew into a huge passion for us all. We decided to call ourselves Interactive Jeans.

                        <p>
                            For the next 2 years, we were constantly testing and improving the game and I was creating mountains of artwork.
                            On December 16th, 2017, we launched our project on Kickstarter and it did not reach its goal, only
                            getting a few hundred dollars.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, our spirits were not crushed, and we took the opportunity to reevaluate and improve our board game, as
                            each change made the game better and better. We did some very mature things, like do public playtests at a board game cafe,
                            print business cards, and film a new trailer.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After redoing our Kickstarter page and planning a launch party, we relaunched our campaign on July 21, 2018. Unfortunately,
                            the Kickstarter marketplace is very competitive so we did not reach our goal, but we did reach over $1,500 in contributions,
                            which we were very proud of.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the end, we ordered a copy of the game for each of us and close friends, and we still play Knock-Out! Global Smackdown today.
                            When it sits on the shelf it reminds us of how much time we spent together.

                <h4 class="section-header">The Rules Summary</h4>
                <p>Want to learn how to play? Here's a quick idea of how the game works:</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm-6">
                        <h5>Action Phase</h5>
                        <p>
                            On your turn, you can take up to 3 Actions from the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li><i class="fas fa-play"></i>Draw a Card from one of the decks, Melee, Range, and Quick</li>
                                <img class="inline-img" src="projects/knock-out/decks.png" alt="decks">
                                <li><i class="fas fa-play"></i>Move your Fighter up to 2 Spaces</li>
                                <img class="inline-img" src="projects/knock-out/movefighter.gif" alt="move fighters">
                                <li><i class="fas fa-play"></i>Play an Attack</li>
                                <img class="inline-img" src="projects/knock-out/attackCard.gif" alt="attack">
                            </ul>
                            When an attack is successful, the Target takes its Damage and the Attacker gains Glory Points based on how awesome their attack was.
                            <img class="inline-img" src="projects/knock-out/damage.gif" alt="damage gif">
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are two kinds of attacks in Knock-Out!. <b>Melee</b> attacks allow players to pummel someone from close up. 
                            There are also <b>Range</b> attacks, which you can use to snipe from across the map.
                        </p>
                        <img class="inline-img" src="projects/knock-out/MeleeRangeGraphic-01.png" alt="melee-range-graphic">
                        <p>
                            Shields can be used to block attacks when they are flipped from your moveset. 
                            They can only block one type of attack, though, so you'll have to be sure that you've predicted your opponent's strategy.
                        </p>
                        <img class="inline-img" src="projects/knock-out/ShieldsGraphic-01.png" alt="shields-graphics">

                        <h5>Prep Phase</h5>
                        <p>
                            After you finish taking your Actions, each player can set up to 2 cards from their Hand into their Moveset 
                            to use on their next turn.
                        </p>
                        <img class="inline-img" src="projects/knock-out/slotcard.gif">
                        <p>
                            Because you have to show what kinds of attacks you're using a turn in advance, other Fighters can try to predict 
                            your strategies before you use them.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Ending the Match</h5>
                        <p>
                            Each Match ends when someone gets a Knock-Out (loses all their health) or becomes the Fan Favorite (reaches 15 GP).
                        </p>

                            This project was very large, and therefore I had to wear many hats throughout the development process.
                            My biggest role was artwork, where I created 162 cards, box art, marketing graphics, instructions, and various other pieces
                            of art for the game.

                            I also created graphics and video content, which were used for our Kickstarter campaign and our social media, many
                            of which you are seeing on this website now.
